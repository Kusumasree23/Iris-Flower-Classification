🌸 Iris Flower Classification - Machine Learning Project
This project classifies Iris Flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) using Machine Learning (Random Forest Classifier). It follows data acquisition, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

📌 Project Overview
Iris classification is a common machine learning task in which we predict the species of an Iris flower based on its sepal and petal dimensions.
This project uses the Scikit-learn Iris dataset, a popular dataset in ML.

✨ Features
✔ Preprocessing: Data Cleaning & Preparation
✔ ML Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier
✔ Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix
✔ Visualization: Matplotlib & Seaborn
✔ Data Ingestion: CSV file (optional for Azure Data Factory)

📂 Dataset Used
Scikit-learn's built-in Iris dataset

Contains 150 samples with 4 features:

Sepal length (cm)

Sepal width (cm)

Petal length (cm)

Petal width (cm)

Target: Flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

🛠 Project Steps

1️⃣ Data Collection
Loaded Iris dataset using sklearn.datasets.load_iris()

2️⃣ Data Preprocessing
Checked for missing values

Mapped species labels to names

3️⃣ Data Splitting
Split dataset into 80% train and 20% test

4️⃣ Model Training
Used Random Forest Classifier (100 estimators)

Trained the model using train data

5️⃣ Model Evaluation
Predicted species on test data

Evaluated using Accuracy Score, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report

6️⃣ Data Visualization
Confusion Matrix heatmap using seaborn

Pairplot analysis for feature distribution

💡 Future Improvements
🔹 Use Deep Learning (Neural Networks)
🔹 Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy
🔹 Deploy model as a REST API
